0022796bb2112abd2e6423ba2d57751db06049fb,Public Health Responses to and Challenges for the Control of Dengue Transmission in High-Income Countries: Four Case Studies,"dengue has a negative impact in low-and lower middle-income countries, but also affects upper middle-and high-income countries. despite the efforts at controlling this disease, it is unclear why dengue remains an issue in affluent countries. a better understanding of dengue epidemiology and its burden, and those of chikungunya virus and zika virus which share vectors with dengue, is required to prevent the emergence of these diseases in highincome countries in the future. the purpose of this review was to assess the relative burden of dengue in four high-income countries and to appraise the similarities and differences in dengue transmission. we searched pubmed, isi web of science, and google scholar using specific  for articles published up to 05 may 2016. we found that outbreaks rarely occur where only aedes albopictus is present. the main similarities between countries uncovered by our review are the proximity to dengue-endemic countries, the presence of a competent mosquito vector, a largely nonimmune population, and a lack of citizens' engagement in control of mosquito breeding. we identified important epidemiological and environmental issues including the increase of local transmission despite control efforts, population growth, difficulty locating larval sites, and increased human mobility from neighboring endemic countries. budget cuts in health and lack of practical vaccines contribute to an increased risk. to be successful, dengue-control programs for high-income countries must consider the epidemiology of dengue in other countries and use this information to minimize virus importation, improve the control of the cryptic larval habitat, and engage the community in reducing vector breeding. finally, the presence of a communicable disease center is critical for managing and reducing future disease risks."

0ad7c9ac2c3ced6c5cee4267796228ca532da097,Molecular Mechanism for Antibody-Dependent Enhancement of Coronavirus Entry VIRUS-CELL INTERACTIONS crossm," antibody-dependent enhancement of viral entry, mers coronavirus, sars coronavirus, spike protein, neutralizing antibody, viral receptor, igg fc receptor, antibody-dependent enhancement of viral entry a ntibody-dependent enhancement (ade) occurs when antibodies facilitate viral entry into host cells and enhance viral infection in these cells (1, 2). ade has been observed for a variety of viruses, most notably flaviviruses (e.g., dengue virus) (3-6). it has been shown that when patients are infected by one serotype of dengue virus (i.e., primary infection), they produce neutralizing antibodies targeting the same serotype of the virus. however, if they are later infected by another serotype of dengue virus (i.e., secondary infection), the preexisting antibodies cannot fully neutralize the virus. instead, the antibodies first bind to the virus and then bind to the igg fc receptors on immune cells and mediate viral entry into these cells. a similar mechanism has been observed for hiv and ebola viruses (7-10). thus, subneutralizing antibodies (or nonneutralizing antibodies in some cases) are responsible for ade of these viruses. given the critical roles of antibodies in host immunity, ade causes serious concerns in epidemiology, vaccine design, and antibody-based drug therapy. this study reveals a novel mechanism for ade in which fully neutralizing antibodies mimic the function of viral receptor in mediating viral entry into fc receptor-expressing cells."
